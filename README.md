# CS112Website_Final
The website that I created is meant to be an informational/blog type of website where
I list my top 5 locations to get a great view of Los Angeles. My website includes an
image carousel in the landing page that shows images of Los Angeles from the locations 
that I list on the service.html page. My web pages also have a few animations and also 
has a few Javascript events.
